# LibraryManagementSystem

Project Idea: "Library Management System"

Description:

Create a simple library management system where users can browse and borrow books. The system will provide an API for managing books, users, and borrowing transactions.

Components:

Spring Boot: Use Spring Boot to develop the backend of the application. It will handle the business logic, API endpoints, and database integration.
Swagger: Implement Swagger to create a RESTful API documentation. Swagger will provide an interactive UI where users can explore the available endpoints, request/response models, and test the API directly.
H2 Database: Utilize the H2 in-memory database as the data store for the library management system. It will store information about books, users, and borrowing transactions. H2 is a lightweight and easy-to-use database, perfect for dummy projects.
JUnit: Employ JUnit for unit testing. Write test cases to ensure the correctness of the implemented functionalities, such as creating a new book, borrowing a book, returning a book, and searching for books by various criteria.
Features:

Book Management:
Add new books to the library.
Update book details (e.g., title, author, genre, availability).
Delete books from the library.
Search for books based on title, author, or genre.
User Management:
Register new users.
Update user information (e.g., name, contact details).
Delete user accounts.
View user borrowing history.
Borrowing Management:
Allow users to borrow books from the library.
Track borrowing dates and due dates.
Enable users to return books.
API Documentation:
Use Swagger to generate comprehensive API documentation.
Describe each API endpoint, input parameters, and response structures.
Provide example requests and responses.
Unit Testing:
Write JUnit test cases to validate the functionality of the application.
Test various scenarios, such as adding books, borrowing books, and searching for books.
Remember, this is a dummy project idea to practice using Spring Boot, Swagger, H2 database, and JUnit. You can expand on these features or add additional functionality based on your learning goals and requirements.
